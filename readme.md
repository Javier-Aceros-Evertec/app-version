# Track the version of your app

The `placetopay/app-version` package provides a way to know which version of your app is currently deployed.

It can be used with [Envoyer](https://envoyer.io/) deployment hooks

It can be integrated with [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to help you keep track of Releases and Deploys in the Sentry Dashboard 

## Installation

Add the private repository information to your `composer.json` file

```json
{
  "repositories": [{
    "type": "composer",
    "url": "https://dev.placetopay.com/repository"
  }]
}
```

Install using composer

```bash
composer require placetopay/app-version ^2.0
```

The package will automatically register itself.

Publish the configuration file

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="PlacetoPay\AppVersion\VersionServiceProvider"
```

Set up your environment variables at `config/app-version.php`

```php
return [
    'sentry' => [
        /*
         * The sentry auth token used to authenticate with Sentry Api
         * Create tokens here at account level https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
         * Or here at organization level https://sentry.io/settings/your-organization/developer-settings/
         */
        'auth_token' => env('APP_VERSION_SENTRY_AUTH'),

        /*
         * The organization name this project belongs to, you can find out the
         * organization at https://sentry.io/settings/
         */
        'organization' => env('APP_VERSION_SENTRY_ORGANIZATION', 'placetopay'),

        /*
         * The repository name of this project. Repositories are added in sentry as integrations.
         * You must add your (Github|Bitbucket) integration at https://sentry.io/settings/your-organization/integrations/
         * and then add the repositories you want to track commits
         */
        'repository' => env('APP_VERSION_SENTRY_REPOSITORY'),

        /*
         * The name of this project in Sentry Dashboard
         * You can find out the project name at https://sentry.io/settings/your-organization/projects/
         */
        'project' => env('APP_VERSION_SENTRY_PROJECT'),
    ],

    /*
     * The current deployed version, will be read from version file
     * generated by `php artisan app-version:create ...` command
     */
    'version' => \PlacetoPay\AppVersion\VersionFile::readSha(),
];
```

## Usage

On deployment time (Envoyer Hooks) run the command to create your version file, make sure this hook runs before your run `php artisan config:cache` so the version is cached.

```shell
php artisan app-version:create --sha={{ sha }} --time={{ time }} --project={{ project }} --branch={{ branch }}
```

This will generate your version file at `storage/app/app-version.json` 

If you are integrating with Sentry Releases/Deployments/Issues, Add these hooks so Sentry can track your deployments.
Make sure you add this hook after you run `php artisan config:cache` 

```shell
php artisan app-version:create-release

php artisan app-version:create-deploy
``` 

## Know the current Version

You can visit `https://yourapp.com/version`

You can access your current version using 

```php 
config('app-version.version'); 
// or
PlacetoPay\AppVersion\VersionFile::readSha()
```
